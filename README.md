# YSIs_for_prediction
Updated csv of experimentally-determined YSIs at Yale University by the Pfefferle group.

This csv may contain unpublished results, and data may be changed without notice at any time.

## Adding new YSI measurements
To add new measurements, fork this repository and edit the `ysi.csv` with the new compounds, using rdkit to canonicalize the SMILES strings. Then use a pull request and I'll merge the changes.
